## This is your jobfile: use it to tell Jobber what jobs you want it to
## run on your behalf.  For details of what you can specify here,
## please see https://dshearer.github.io/jobber/doc/.
##
## It consists of two sections: "prefs" and "jobs".  In "prefs" you can
## set various general settings.  In "jobs", you define your jobs.

[prefs]
## You can have the Jobber daemon keep a log of various activities
## with the "logPath" setting; the log will be written to the given
## path (if the path is relative, it will be interpreted relative to
## your home directory).  Your user account must be able to write to
## the given path.  NOTE: This is NOT where logs about job runs
## are stored --- for that, see the "runLog" setting below.  WARNING:
## Jobber will NOT rotate this file.
logPath: /var/log/jobber-logs/jobber-info.log

## The following line makes jobber run a specified program when a job
## fails/succeeds:
#notifyProgram: /home/handleError.sh

## You can specify how info about past runs is stored.  For
## "type: memory" (the default), they are stored in memory and
## are lost when the Jobber service stops.
#runLog:
#    type: memory
#    maxLen: 100  # the max number of entries to remember

## For "type: file", past run logs are stored on disk.  The log file is
## rotated when it reaches a size of 'maxFileLen' MB.  Up to
## 'maxHistories' historical run logs (that is, not including the
## current one) are kept.
runLog:
    type: file
    path: /var/log/jobber-logs/jobber-runs.log
    maxFileLen: 50m  # in MB
    maxHistories: 5

[jobs]
## This section must contain a YAML sequence of maps like the following:
- name: Artisan schedule run
  cmd: cd /var/www/html && php artisan schedule:run 
  time: '0 * * * * *'  # SEC MIN HOUR MONTH_DAY MONTH WEEK_DAY.
  onError: Continue  # what to do when the job has an error: Stop, Backoff, or Continue
  notifyOnError: false  # whether to call notifyProgram when the job has an error
  notifyOnFailure: true  # whether to call notifyProgram when the job stops due to errors
  notifyOnSuccess: false  # whether to call notifyProgram when the job succeeds
